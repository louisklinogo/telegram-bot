## üöÄ Recommended Next Actions (Priority Order)

### Option A: Polish & Ship MVP (Recommended - 2-3 hours)
1. Add auto-save (1 hour) - Biggest UX win
2. Wire logo upload to Supabase (30 mins)
3. Test complete flow (30 mins)
4. Fix any blocking issues (1 hour)
5. **Ship MVP and gather user feedback**

### Option B: Add PDF Generation (Critical - 2-3 hours)
1. Install @react-pdf/renderer
2. Create invoice PDF template
3. Add download button
4. Test PDF generation
5. Add email sending (if time allows)

### Option C: Build More Features (Risky - 5-10 hours)
1. Add all medium priority features
2. Risk: Takes longer, delays feedback
3. Recommendation: Ship MVP first, then iterate
