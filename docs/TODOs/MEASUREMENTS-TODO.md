# Measurements Page Refactor & Enhancement TODO

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy Change**
- ❌ Remove rigid garment type constraints (kaftan, shirt, trouser)
- ✅ Generic, flexible measurements that work for ANY garment
- ✅ Versioning system for measurement history tracking
- ✅ Match clients page polish and functionality

---

## 🗄️ **Phase 1: Database Schema & Backend ✅ COMPLETED**

### Database Migration ✅
- [x] Add versioning fields to measurements table:
  - `version` (INTEGER, default 1) ✅
  - `measurement_group_id` (UUID) - Groups all versions together ✅
  - `previous_version_id` (UUID, nullable) - Links to parent version ✅
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default true) - Current active version ✅
  - `tags` (TEXT[]) - Flexible tags replacing garment_type ✅
- [x] Make `garment_type` field nullable (kept for backward compatibility) ✅
- [x] Add index on `measurement_group_id` for version queries ✅
- [x] Add index on `client_id + is_active` for active measurement queries ✅
- [x] Create migration file: `drizzle/0006_amazing_speed_demon.sql` ✅

**📋 SQL to run manually:**
```sql
-- User will run migration SQL manually (see drizzle/0006_amazing_speed_demon.sql)
```

### Schema Updates (`packages/database/src/schema.ts`) ✅

- [x] Create `getMeasurementHistory(db, { clientId })` - Get version timeline ✅
- [x] Update existing queries to handle new fields ✅
- [x] Add query to compare two measurement versions (diff) ✅

### tRPC Router Updates (`apps/api/src/trpc/routers/measurements.ts`) ✅
- [x] Update `list` procedure to include version data ✅
- [x] Create `createVersion` procedure - Clone measurement as new version ✅

- [ ] ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] ✅ Manual testing checklist completed
- [ ] ✅ URL state works (shareable links)
- [ ] ✅ Empty states and error handling are polished
- [ ] ✅ Mobile responsive
- [ ] ✅ Code is clean and well-documented

## 🚀 **Implementation Order (Recommended)**

1. **Start:** Phase 1 (Database & Backend) - Foundation
2. **Then:** Phase 2 (Measurement Form) - Core UX
3. **Then:** Phase 3 (Main Page) - Feature parity with clients
4. **Then:** Phase 4 (Polish) - Advanced features
5. **Finally:** Phase 5 & 6 (Testing & Docs) - Quality assurance

**Estimated Timeline:** 3-5 days for full implementation

---

## 🤔 **Open Questions / Decisions Needed**

- [ ] Should we completely remove `garment_type` column or just make it optional/migrate to tags?
- [ ] Default measurement fields to suggest when creating new measurement?
- [ ] Units system: Support both inches and cm, or pick one?
- [ ] Version naming convention: Auto-generate or always require user input?
- [ ] Max number of versions to keep? Or unlimited with archive option?
- [ ] Should deleted versions stay in chain or break the previous_version_id link?
