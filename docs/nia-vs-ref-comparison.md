### 3. **Search Approach**

#### Nia - Semantic Understanding 🧠
```
Query: "HydrateClient tRPC server setup"
↓
AI understands:
- You want to know about the HydrateClient pattern
- It's related to tRPC
- It's about server-side setup
- Context: Next.js Server Components
↓
Finds:
- Core implementation file (server.tsx)
- Related setup files (query-client.ts, client.tsx)
- Usage examples (pages)
- Supporting code (init.ts, routers)
↓
Synthesizes into comprehensive answer
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Understands **intent** not just keywords
- ✅ Finds **conceptually related** code
- ✅ Provides **narrative explanation**
- ✅ Great for **learning patterns**

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Can timeout on complex queries
- ⚠️ May miss very specific edge cases
- ⚠️ Requires good semantic indexing

#### Ref - Documentation Search 📖
```
Query: "ref_src=private HydrateClient tRPC"
↓
Searches indexed docs for:
- Files mentioning "HydrateClient"
- Files mentioning "tRPC"
- Files mentioning both
↓
Returns:
- List of matching files
- Brief context per file
- URLs to read full content
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Fast keyword matching
- ✅ Finds **exact occurrences**
- ✅ Good for **reference lookup**
- ✅ Direct file URLs

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Less context about relationships
- ⚠️ Need to read multiple files manually
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain patterns
- ⚠️ More work to synthesize information
