⛬  Here’s what I recommend we tackle next (in order):

   •  Stabilize WhatsApp sessions: persistent session registry (no re‑starts while running),
       reconnect on disconnect, proper lifecycle logs/health.
   •  Conversation UI + send: thread detail view that streams messages from
      communication_messages, composer to send text/media via Baileys, delivery/read
      updates.
   •  Accounts management: page to add/remove/reconnect multiple WhatsApp numbers; show
      status, QR, and last activity.
   •  Instagram (Meta) messaging: webhook + send APIs mirroring WhatsApp flow; unify into
      same threads/messages model.
   •  Campaigns/templates/automations: endpoints + UI, enforce consent/quiet hours/rate
      limits; store per-channel opt‑in/out.
   •  Linkage: quick actions to create/attach orders/invoices/transactions; store
      attachments in vault and show in thread.
   •  Security/ops: Supabase Auth + RLS middleware in tRPC, secrets handling, metrics
      (/health, message rates), retries, and tests (unit/integration/E2E).



⛬  •  Your original chat UI isn’t gone — I temporarily swapped in a minimal “ThreadView +
      composer” to get a production-safe E2E path (live read/write via our new
      API/worker/Supabase) without breaking while we stabilized the backend; your existing
      Inbox components remain and I can re‑wire them to the new endpoints next so you keep
      your full design and features.
   •  The worker logs you shared show normal Baileys pairing/initial sync churn (515 stream
      restarts, pre‑key uploads) followed by stable “opened connection” and repeated
      “status=connected”; this is expected after device pairing and we now guard against
      duplicate sockets.
   If you’re ready, I’ll re-integrate your chat component with the live thread/messages APIs
    (keep filters/search, delivery/read ticks) and remove the temporary UI.
