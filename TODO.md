## 🚨 Phase 1: Critical Architecture Fixes (Week 1-2)
**Status:** 🟢 COMPLETED ✅  
**Progress:** 11/12 tasks completed (92%) - Remaining task deferred to Phase 4  
**Priority:** ✅ COMPLETED - Excellent foundation established!

### 1.1 Remove Anti-Patterns

#### Task 1.1.1: Remove Custom Input Processor Anti-Pattern
- [x] **Delete MessageProcessor class** from `src/mastra/agents/telegramInvoiceAgent.ts` ✅ 2025-01-27
  - File: `src/mastra/agents/telegramInvoiceAgent.ts` (lines 64-160)
  - Remove the entire `MessageProcessor` class
  - Remove `inputProcessors: [new MessageProcessor() as any]` from agent config
  - **Why:** Creates agents inside processors (anti-pattern), causes memory leaks

- [x] **Replace with lightweight message validation** ✅ 2025-01-27
  - ~~Create `src/telegram/messageValidator.ts`~~ (Not needed - handled in agent instructions)
  - ~~Add simple Zod schemas for message validation~~ (Simplified approach)
  - Move intent classification to agent instructions instead of processor

- [x] **Simplify agent instructions** ✅ 2025-01-27
  - Remove complex processing logic from instructions
  - Focus on clear, simple task descriptions
  - Let agent decide tools naturally without pre-processing

#### Task 1.1.2: Separate Grammy Bot from Mastra
- [x] **Create clean HTTP API layer** ✅ 2025-01-27
  - Create `src/api/telegramApi.ts` for HTTP endpoints
  - Create `src/telegram/botHandler.ts` for Grammy bot logic
  - Remove direct agent calls from Grammy handlers

- [x] **Implement proper request/response flow** ✅ 2025-01-27
  - Grammy receives message → Validates → HTTP POST to Mastra API → Returns response
  - Add proper error handling for API communication
  - Ensure no direct agent instantiation in Grammy code

### 1.2 Fix Mastra Integration

#### Task 1.2.1: Correct Mastra Configuration
- [x] **Fix `src/mastra/index.ts`** ✅ 2025-01-27
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE (incorrect)
  export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { telegramInvoiceAgent },
    bundler: { sourcemap: true, transpilePackages: ['node-fetch'] },
    serverMiddleware: [/* custom middleware */],
  });
  
  // AFTER (correct)
  export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { telegramInvoiceAgent },
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: "file:./mastra-data.db" }),
    logger: new PinoLogger({ name: 'Cimantikos-Bot', level: 'info' }),
    workflows: { invoiceWorkflow, measurementWorkflow },
    server: { port: 4111, host: '0.0.0.0', cors: {...} }
  });
  ```

- [x] **Remove incorrect configurations** ✅ 2025-01-27
  - Remove `bundler` configuration (not needed for this use case)
  - Remove `serverMiddleware` (use proper middleware instead)
  - Add missing required configurations (storage, server, logger)

#### Task 1.2.2: Agent Implementation Fixes
- [x] **Simplify telegramInvoiceAgent** ✅ 2025-09-27
  - ✅ Removed complex processing logic from instructions

  - ✅ Tools are properly bound to agent configuration
  - ✅ Created measurement validation system with proper tool integration
  - ✅ Agent decides tool usage naturally through instructions

### 1.3 Memory & Storage

#### Task 1.3.1: Fix Memory Configuration
- [x] **Change memory storage from in-memory to persistent** ✅ 2025-01-27
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE
  const memory = new Memory({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: ':memory:' })
  });
  
  // AFTER  
  const memory = new Memory({
    options: {
      workingMemory: { enabled: true }
      // semanticRecall disabled due to missing vector module
    },
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: "file:./telegram-bot.db" })
  });
  ```

  - ✅ WARP.md documentation created with comprehensive architecture guide
  
- [ ] **Re-enable semantic recall when vector module available** ⏸️ DEFERRED
  - Install or configure proper vector store package
  - Add semantic recall back to memory options
  - Test vector-based memory retrieval
  - **Note**: Deferred to Phase 4 due to vector store complexity

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

1. **Never skip Phase 1** - Architecture issues will compound if not fixed first
2. **Test after each major change** - Don't break working functionality
3. **Keep business logic intact** - Focus on architecture, not feature changes
4. **Document as you go** - Don't leave documentation until the end
5. **Quality over speed** - Better to do it right than fast

---

## 📞 Getting Help

If you get stuck on any task:

1. **Check the REFACTORING_PLAN.md** for context and architecture diagrams
2. **Review Mastra documentation** for specific patterns
3. **Look at the evaluation report** for specific code examples
4. **Create minimal reproduction cases** for testing changes
