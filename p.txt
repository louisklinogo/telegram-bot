# Comprehensive Database Analysis and Implementation Plan

Before proceeding with any database operations, ensure a thorough understanding of all available fields and structures:

1. **Database Field Analysis**
   - Use the Notion MCP server to discover all fields in each database
   - Document the complete schema for each database table
   - Identify relationships between different database entities
   - Ensure comprehensive view of all data structures

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Create a detailed plan before implementing any changes
   - Maintain context throughout the analysis and implementation process
   - Use Notion MCP to properly discover all required information about Notion databases
   - Document findings to prevent loss of context

3. **Measurement Data Handling**
   - Do not skip measurements database in your analysis
   - Utilize existing measurement data structures and tools
   - Ensure all measurement fields are properly accounted for
   - Integrate measurement data with other database operations

4. **Verification Requirements**
   - Confirm all fields are captured in your analysis
   - Validate relationships between databases
   - Ensure no data structures are overlooked
   - Test all discovered fields with actual database queries
